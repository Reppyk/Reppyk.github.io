# Food'n'drink

Don't stress much about it ; I always have something around to survive.

Available drinks are usually :
- Cider :apple: :green_apple:
- Beer :beer:
- Orange juice :orange:

If you're bringing something, don't forget that greasy food is not allowed in the gaming area. So forget about these Doritos. And I don't own any microwave oven. :no_entry:

> Do not forget to warn about any food allergy or restriction. :stuck_out_tongue:
